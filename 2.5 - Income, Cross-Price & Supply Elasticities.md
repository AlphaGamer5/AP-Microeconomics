  -  Meaning
    
      -  Measure used to show the change in the **price** of **one
         good** affecs the **demand** for **another good**.

  -  Formula
    
      -  Percentage change in **Quantity Demanded** of **Good A**
         divided by **Percentage change** in **Price** of **Good
         B**

  ![The Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand The cross-price elasticity of
  demand measures how the quantity demanded of one good responds to a
  change in the price of another good. It is calculated as the
  percentage change in quantity de- manded of good 1 divided by the
  percentage change in the price of good 2. That is, Percentage change
  in quantity demanded of good 1 Cross-price elasticity of demand =
  Percentage change in the price of good 2 ](./media/image65.png)

# Substitutes 

  -  Definition
    
      -  If the coefficient is **positive**, then the two items are
         **substitutes.**
    
      -  \*Do **NOT** find the absolute value for cross-price
         elasticity\!

  -  E<sub>A,B</sub> and substitutes
    
      -  The **higher** the number, the **more perfect** the two items
         are as **substitutes.**
    
      -  The **lower** the number, the **less perfect** the two items
         are as **substitutes.**

  -  Price change and quantity demanded
    
      -  If the **price** of Good A **increases** , then the **quantity
         demanded** of Good B will **increase**.
    
      -  If the **price** of Good A **decreases**, then the **quantity
         demanded** of Good B will **decrease**.

# Complements

  -  Definition
    
      -  If the coefficient is **negative**, then the two items are
         **complements.**
    
      -  \*Do **NOT** find the absolute value for cross-price
         elasticity\!

  -  E<sub>A,B</sub> and substitutes
    
      -  The **more negative** the number, the **more perfect** the two
         items are as **complements.**
    
      -  The **less negative** the number, the **less perfect** the two
         items are as **complements.**

  -  Price change and quantity demanded
    
      -  If the **price** of Good A **increases** , then the **quantity
         demanded** of Good B will **decrease**.
    
      -  If the **price** of Good A **decreases**, then the **quantity
         demanded** of Good B will **increase**.

# Income Elasticity of Demand

  -  Meaning
    
      -  Measures how changes in **income** affect the **demand** for a
         good

  -  Normal good vs. Inferior good
    
      -  If the income elasticity of demand is **positive**, then it's
         a **normal** good.
    
      -  If the income elasticity of demand is **negative**, then it's
         a **inferior** good.

  -  Income-elastic vs. income-inelastic
    
      -  If the income elasticity of demand is **greater than 1**, then
         it is **income-elastic**
    
      -  If the income elasticity of demand is **less than 1**, then it
         is **income-inelastic**

  -  Formula
    
      -  Percentage change in **Quantity Demanded** Divided by
         Percentage change in
         **Income**

# Price Elasticity of Supply

  -  Meaning
    
      -  Measure of responsiveness of the quantity of a good
         **supplied** to the **price** of that good

  -  Formula
    
      -  **Percentage** change in **quantity supplied** divided by the
         **percentage** change in
         **price**
    
      -  ![C:\\CE5A5F25\\EA5686BB-78FF-4844-9ADF-D3586C9ED368\_files\\image072.png](./media/image72.png)

  -  Availability of inputs affects elasticity
    
      -  Supply of pizza tends to be very elastic

  ![Panel (b) shows the supply curve for pizza. We suppose that it costs
  $12 to produce a pizza, including all opportunity costs. At any price
  below $12, it would be unprofitable to produce pizza and all the pizza
  parlors would go out of business. At a price of $12 or more, there are
  many producers who could operate pizza parlors. The ingredients—
  flour, tomatoes, cheese—are plentiful. And if necessary, more tomatoes
  could be grown, more milk could be produced to make mozzarella cheese,
  and so on. So by allowing profits, any price above $12 would elicit
  the supply of an extremely large quantity of pizzas. The implied
  supply curve is therefore a horizontal line at $12. Since even a tiny
  in- crease in the price would lead to an enormous increase in the
  quantity ](./media/image73.png)

  -  Supply of cell phone frequencies is zero. The input (radio
     spectrum) cannot be changed

  ![As in the case of demand, the extreme values of the price elasticity
  of supply have a simple graphical representation. Panel (a) of Figure
  48.1 shows the supply ofcell phone frequencies, the portion of the
  radio spectrum that is suitable for sending and receiv- ing cell phone
  signals. Governments own the right to sell the use of this part of the
  radio spectrum to cell phone operators inside their borders. But
  governments can't in- crease or decrease the number of cell phone
  frequencies they have to offer—for techni- cal reasons, the quantity
  of frequencies suitable for cell phone operation is fixed. So the
  supply curve for cell phone frequencies is a vertical line, which we
  have assumed is set at the quantity of 100 frequencies. As you move up
  and down that curve, the change in the quantity supplied by the
  government is zero, whatever the change in price. So panel (a)
  illustrates a case of perfectly inelastic supply, meaning that the
  price elasticity of supply is zero. ](./media/image74.png)
