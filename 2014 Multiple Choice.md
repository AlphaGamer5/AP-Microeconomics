  ![If the price of a good increases, then there will be two different
  effects - known as the income and substitution effect. If a good
  increases in price. 1 . The good is relatively more expensive than
  alternative goods and people can switch to other goods. (substitution
  effect) 2. The increase in price reduces disposable income and this
  lower income may reduce demand. (income effect) The substitution
  effect states that an increase in the price of a good will encourage
  consumers to buy alternative goods. The substitution effect measures
  how much the higher price encourages consumers to use other goods,
  assuming the same level of income. The income effect looks at how the
  price change effects consumer income. If price rises, it effectively
  cuts disposable income and there will be lower demand. For example: •
  If the price of meat increases, then the higher price may encourage
  consumers to switch to alternative food sources, such as buying
  vegetables. • However, with the higher price of meat, it means that
  after buying some meat, they will have lower spare income. Therefore,
  consumers will buy less meat because of this income effect. If a good
  like a diamond increases, there will be little substitution effect
  because there are no alternatives to diamonds. However, a higher price
  of diamonds will lower demand because of the income effect.

# Question 24

  ![24. Which of the following statements correctly identifies a
  difference between perfect competition and monopolistic competition?
  (A) In perfect competition there are no barriers to entry, but there
  are strong barriers in monopolistic competition. (B) In perfect
  competition there are many firms, but in monopolistic competition
  there are onl a few firms. C) In perfect competition the firms all
  sell products that are exactly the same, but in monopolistic
  competition each firm sells a sli htl differentiated duct. (D) In
  perfect competition firms maximize profit by selling the quantity
  where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, but in monopolistic
  competition firms maximize profit by selling the quantity where
  marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost. (E) In perfect competition
  there are few consumers, but in monopolistic competition there are
  many consumers. ](./media/image269.png)
  
  ![How does Monopolistic Competition differ from Perfect Competition?
  Number of producers (sellers in the market) Types of goods and
  services available for consumers Does the firm have control over their
  own prices? Is branding / marketing important? Are entry barriers
  zero, low or high? Perfect Competition Many Homogeneous NO — price
  takers NO Zero barriers Does this market structure lead to allocative
  yes: Price = MC efficiency in the long run? Does this market structure
  lead to yes - min LRAC productive efficiency in the long run?
  Monopolistic Competition Many Differentiated Yes — some pricing power
  Yes — key non-price competition Low barriers Not quite (P\>MC) No —
  higher LRAC ](./media/image270.png)

  ![Profit Maximization. The monopolist's profit maximizing level of
  output is found by equating its marginal revenue with its marginal
  cost, which is the same profit maximizing condition that a perfectly
  competitive firm uses to determine its equilibrium level of output.

# Question 28

  -  Marginal revenue product

  ![Marginal revenue product (MRP), also known as the marginal value
  product, is the market value of one additional unit of output.

  -  Marginal product

  ![In economics and in particular neoclassical economics, the marginal
  product or marginal physical product of an input (factor of
  production) is the change in output resulting from employing one more
  unit of a particular input (for instance, the change in output when a
  firm's labor is increased from five to six units), Marginal product -

  -  Relationship between Marginal revenue product and Marginal product

  ![The Value of the Marginal Product and the Demand for Labor The value
  of the marginal product is the marginal product of the input
  multiplied by the market price of the output. l/ A/IPL = MPL x p MRP =
  MPLxP The value of the marginal product (also known as marginal
  revenue product) is measured in dollars. • It diminishes as the number
  of workers rises because the market price of the good is constant.

  a profit-maximizing firm. Which of the following is true of the firm's
  hiring of labor? (A) It should hire 15 workers. (B) It should hire
  between 15 and 40 workers. (C) It should hire 40 workers. It should
  hire between 40 and 90 workers. It should hire 90 workers.

# Question 56

  ![56. Which of the following is true of a monopolisti- cally
  competitive firm in long-run equilibrium? (A) (B) (D) (E) Price equals
  marginal cost and average total cost. Price equals average total cost
  but is greater than mar 'nal cost. Price equals marginal cost and is
  greater than average total cost. The firm makes no attempt to
  differentiate its products. The firm earns positive economic profits
  by producing at minimum average cost. ](./media/image281.png)
