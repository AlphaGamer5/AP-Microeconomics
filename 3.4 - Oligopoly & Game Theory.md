# Characteristics of an Oligopoly

  -  Characterized by **interdependence**, a relationship in which the
     outcome of each firm **depends on** the **actions** of the
     **others**

  -  There are a "**few**" sellers in the market with **significant
     control** of **pricing**

  -  If there are only **two** sellers, it's **duopoly**

  -  Firms in an oligopoly have an incentive to **collude**, which is
     the act of "**cooperating**" or "**not cheating**" in order to
     **increase joint profits**

  -  **Cartel** is a group of producers that agree to **restrict
     output** in order to **increase prices** and **profits**

# Game Theory

  -  The study of **behavior** in situations of **interdependence** is
     knowns as **game theory**

  -  We will be examining a two-player model
    
      -  the x-player and the y-player **(x,y)**

  -  In our pay off matrix, there will only be **two** possible
     **choices**
    
      -  High/Low
    
      -  Confess/Not Confess
    
      -  Early/Late

  -  **Two firms** are playing a "game" in which profits are
     **dependent** on other firms' **actions**

  -  **Applications** in economics, military strategy, politics

  -  **John Nash**, a mathematician, won the **Nobel Prize** in
     **economics** for his work

  -  **Nash equilibrium** is the result when each player chooses the
     action that **maximizes** his or her **payoff**, given the actions
     of other players

 

# Prisoner's Dilemma

  -  **Dominant strategy** means that you will choose the **same option
     regardless** of what your **opponents** does

  -  Prisoner's dilemma means that there exists a **collusive outcome**
     that will **benefit both** players but they will have a **dominant
     strategy** which will yield to the Nash Equilibrium of the
     **lowest** combined **profit** possible

  -  Example 1 (classic)

![Ajinomoto Produce 30 million pounds Ajinomoto makes $180 million
Produce 40 million pounds Ajinomoto makes $200 million profit. Produce
30 million pounds ADM makes $180 million profit. Ajinomoto makes $150
million profit. Produce 40 million pounds ADM makes $200 million profit.
profit. ADM makes $150 million profit. Ajinomoto makes $160 million
profit. ADM makes $160 million profit. ](./media/image144.png)

  -  Two firms, ADM and Ajinomoto, must decide how much lysine to
     produce.

  -  The profits of the two firms are interdependent: Each firm's
     profit depends not only on its own decision but also on the
     other's decision.

  -  Both firms will be **better** **off** if they **both** choose the
     **lower output**

  -  But it is in each firm's **individual** **interest** to choose the
     **higher output**.

  -  Overcoming prisoner's dilemma
    
      -  **Strategic behavior** is when a firm attempts to
         **influence** the **future behavior** of **other** firms.
    
      -  **Tit for tat** strategy involves playing **cooperatively** at
         **first** and then **adjusting** accordingly afterwards.
    
      -  Firms in an oligopoly that do not **explicitly form** a cartel
         can engage in "**tacit collusion**" by limiting **production**
         and **raising prices** without any written agreements
    
      -  **Collusion**, in any firm, is much more likely to take place
         when there are **few firms**
    
      -  With more and **more firms**, there exists **less incentive**
         for a firm to "**cheat**"

  -  Example 3

  ![Hello Market Advertise Not Advertise Advertise A ($250, $210) Not c

| If not advertise | Advertise            | Advertise |
|                  | No dominant strategy | Advertise |

  -  Does Hello Market have a dominant strategy?
    
      -  No

  -  Does H & IPM have a dominant strategy?
    
      -  Yes, to advertise

  -  At the Nash Equilibrium, what is H & IPM's daily profit? What is
     Hello Market's daily profit?
    
      -  Choose B
    
      -  H & IPM's daily profit: $480
    
      -  Hello Market's daily profit: $350

  -  Suppose the cost of advertising is $50 per day, redraw the matrix
     to include advertising costs for each firm
