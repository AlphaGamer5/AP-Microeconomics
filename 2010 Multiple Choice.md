# Question 6

  ![The Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand The cross-price elasticity of
  demand measures how the quantity demanded of one good responds to a
  change in the price of another good. It is calculated as the
  percentage change in quantity de- manded of good 1 divided by the
  percentage change in the price of good 2. That is, Percentage change
  in quantity demanded of good 1 Cross-price elasticity of demand =
  Percentage change in the price of good 2 ](./media/image65.png)

# Question 12

  -  Long-run (Profitability)

  ![Profitability condition (minimum ATC = break-even price) P \>
  minimum ATC P = minimum ATC P < minimum ATC Result Firm profitable.
  Entry into industry in the long run. Firm breaks even. No entry into
  or exit from industry in the long run. Firm unprofitable. Exit from
  industry in the long run. ](./media/image127.png)

  -  Short-run (Production)

  ![Production condition (minimum AVC = shut-down price) P \> minimum
  AVC P = minimum AVC P < minimum AVC Result Firm produces in the short
  run. If P < minimum ATC, firm covers variable cost and some but not
  all of fixed cost. If P \> minimum ATC, firm covers all variable cost
  and fixed cost. Firm indifferent between producing in the short run or
  not. Just covers variable cost. Firm shuts down in the short run. Does
  not cover variable cost. ](./media/image128.png)

# Question 19

  ![19. In microeconomics, the short run is defined as which of the
  following? (A) A period that is less than one year (B) A period that
  is between one year and four years (C) A period that is too shon for a
  firm to be able to chan e its level of output D) A penod during which
  some Inputs rn a firm's production process cannot be chan ed (E) A
  period during which a firm's fixed costs exceed its variable costs
  ](./media/image229.png)

  -  In microeconomics, the **long run** is the conceptual time period
     in which there are no fixed factors of production, so that there
     are no constraints preventing changing the output level by
     changing the capital stock or by entering or leaving an industry.

  -  The long run contrasts with the **short run**, in which some
     factors are variable and **others are fixed**, constraining entry
     or exit from an industry.

  -  In macroeconomics, the long run is the period when the **general
     price level, contractual wage rates, and expectations** adjust
     fully to the state of the economy, in contrast to the short run
     when these variables may not fully adjust.

# Question 26

  ![Introduction to Game Theory Game theory is the branch of decision
  theory concerned with interdependent decisions. The problems of
  interest involve multiple participants, each of whom has individual
  objectives related to a common system or shared resources. Because
  game theory arose from the analysis of competitive scenarios, the
  problems are called games and the participants are called players. But
  these techniques apply to more than just sport, and are not even
  limited to competitive situations. In short, game theory deals with
  any problem in which each player's strategy depends on what the other
  players do. Situations arise frequently, in all walks of life. A few
  examples in which game theory could come in handy include: Friends
  choosing where to go have dinner Parents trying to get children to
  behave Commuters deciding how to go to work Businesses competing in a
  market Diplomats negotiating a treaty Gamblers betting in a card game

  monopolistically competitive firm and a perfectly competitive firm in
  long-run profit- maximizing equilibrium ? (A) Economic profits equal
  zero, and price equals marginal cost. (B) Economic profits equal zero,

  ![price This strategy is based on the fact that the total profit
  reaches its maximum point where marginal revenue equals marginal
  profit . This is the case because the firm will continue to produce
  until marginal profit is equal to zero, and marginal profit equals the
  marginal revenue (MR) minus the marginal cost (MC). Marginal Cost

# Question 47

  ![The bowed-out production possibilities curve for Alpine Sports
  illustrates the law of increasing opportunity cost. Scarcity implies
  that a production possibilities curve is downward sloping; the law of
  increasing opportunity cost implies that it will be bowed out, or
  concave, in shape. 2.2 The Production Possibilities Curve - Flat World
  Knowledge ](./media/image236.png)

  -  The bow-out shape occurs because economic resources are **not
     perfectly adaptable** to the production of different goods and,
     thus, the opportunity cost of producing a good will increase as
     more and more resources are allocated to the production of that
     good.

     profits will decrease

  curve corre- sponding to the demand schedule in the table. The lower
  panel shows how total revenue changes along that demand curve: at each
  price and quantity combination, the height of the bar rep- resents the
  total revenue generated. You can see that at a low price, raising the
  price increases total revenue. So demand is inelastic at low prices.
  At a high price, however, a rise in price reduces total revenue. So
  demand is elastic at high prices. Demand is elastic: a higher price
  reduces total revenue. Demand is inelastic: a higher phce increases
  total revenue. ](./media/image61.png)
