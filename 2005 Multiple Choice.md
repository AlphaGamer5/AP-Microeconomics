# Question 33

  ![33. Which of the following would cause the equilib- rium price of
  good X to increase? (A) Producers of good X find a new technology that
  reduces the cost of oducin X. (B) The price of an essential input in
  the production of good X increases. o s an are comp ements, an the
  government imposes a tax on good Y. (D) Good X is a normal good, and
  the government increases income taxes by 3%. (E) Good X is an inferior
  good, and the government decreases income taxes by 10%.

# Question 41

  -  The price will remain unchanged even if the demand for the good
     increases in the long run.

  MR2 ATC MRI DI Bushels of oats per period q, 02 Bushels of oats per
  period The initial equilibrium price and output are determined in the
  market for oats by the intersection of demand and supply at point A in
  Panel (a). An increase in the market demand for oats, from DI to in
  Panel (a), shifts the equilibrium solution to point B. The price
  increases in the short run from $1.70 per bushel to $2.30. Industry
  output rises to Q2. For a single firm, the increase in price raises
  marginal revenue from MRI to MR2,• the firm responds in the short run
  by increasing its output to (12. It earns an economic profit given by
  the shaded rectangle. In the long run, the opportunity for profit
  attracts new firms. In a constant-cost industry, the short-run supply
  curve shifts to S2,• market equilibrium now moves to point C in Panel
  (a). The market price falls back to $1.70. The firm's demand curve
  returns to MRI, and its output falls back to the original level, ql.
  Industry output has risen to Q3 because there are more firms.

# Question 51

  ![51. Which of the following best explains why the short-run average
  total cost curve is U-shaped? (B) (C (D) (E) Spreading total fixed
  costs over a larger Spreading total fixed costs over a larger output,
  and eventually diminishing returns Increasmg total Ixe costs an

  ![Short-Run Cost The ATC curve is also U- shaped. The MC curve is very
  special. Where AVC is falling, MC is below AVC. Where AVC is rising,
  MC is above AVC. At the minimum AVC, MC equals AVC. Arc 15
