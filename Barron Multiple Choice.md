# Question 1

  ![Natural gas sellers and natural gas buyers constitute a market a
  group of producers and consumers who exchange a good or service for
  payment. In this chapter, we'll focus on a particular type of market
  known as a competitive market. A competitive market is a market in
  which there are many buyers and sellers of the same good or service.
  More precisely, the key feature of a competitive market is that no
  individual's actions have a noticeable effect on the price at which
  the good or service is sold. It's important to understand, however,
  that this is not an accurate description of every market.

# Question 10

  -  The MC curve intersects the ATC curve at the minimum point of the
     ATC curve

  (cases) Minimum-cost output ](./media/image107.png)

# Question 11

  -  When a new computerized system for a firm increases the marginal
     productivity of its workers, the marginal revenue product curve
     will shift to the right, causing the wage rate to increase.

  ![Machine generated alternative text: D = MRP Number of Workers

# Question 14

  -  A consumer surplus is established as the difference between the
     total utility (satisfaction) received and the price paid by the
     consumer.

# Question 19

  -  Profits of an unregulated monopolist: difference between ATC (NOT
     MC) and D times the Quantity

  curve has a "swoosh" shape and the average total cost curve is

# Question 23

  -  If price < ATC, this would result in a loss

  ![Profitability condition (minimum ATC = break-even price) P \>
  minimum ATC P = minimum ATC P < minimum ATC Result Firm profitable.

  or exit from industry in the long run. Firm unprofitable. Exit from
  industry in the long run. ](./media/image127.png)

# Question 24

  -  The government announcement would result in an increase in demand
     for red grape juice. But the change will not be a change along a
     demand curve or a change in quantity demanded.

# Question 29

  -  Source of wage differentials
    
      -  Marginal Productivity and Wage Inequality
        
          -  Compensating differentials
        
          -  Differences in talent
        
          -  Quantity of human capital
    
      -  Market Power
    
      -  Efficiency wage
    
      -  Discrimination

# Question 38

  -  Monopolistic competition is characterized by lower output, higher
     price than competitive industries. Price is greater than MR and
     greater than
  MC

# Question 43

# Question 49

  -  If we pay these costs including the value of what could be earned
     elsewhere with the same resources, we would be paying a transfer
     earning (the value of alternative use of the resources of
     suppliers).

  -  The transfer earning is the minimum price we must pay, as
     consumers, in order to assure a continuing supply of goods and
     services.

  -  Rents are those payments that suppliers receive that are in excess
     of transfer earning or are in excess of what those suppliers could
     earn elsewhere.

  -  These rents cause a reallocation resources away from more
     productive use of resources.

# Question 54

  -  This refers to the interdependence characteristic of oligopoly.

  -  Price decreases are matched in the hope of maintaining or
     increasing market share.

  -  Price increases are not matched for fear of losing market share or
     having the possibility of gaining market share over the
     price-increasing rival

# Question 55

  -  collusive
    
      -  adj. acting together in secret toward a fraudulent or illegal
         end

  -  kinked demand curve
    
      -  This curve illustrates the interdependence of rivals under
         non-collusive oligopoly in which rivals match price decreases
         but do not match price increase of an oligopolist

  ![Fig, 1203(c) Oligopoly—Formation of Kinked Demand Curve (dD)
  ](./media/image308.png)

  -  The major feature of the kinked demand curve is that it consists
     of two segments (one that indicates "following" and the other that
     "does not follow" the price changes of rivals)

# Question 56

  -  Elasticity tends to be greater in the long run since the firm will
     be able to adjust to changes in demand.

  -  The firm will have more options in availability of resources in
     order to substitute less expensive resources (inputs) for more
     expensive resources in the long
  run
