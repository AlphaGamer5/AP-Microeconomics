# Question 1 (a)

  -  Profit-maximizing point

  ![Demand = Marginal Social Benefit Average Total Cost Marginal Cost â€”
  -o OUTPUT QIQ2 Q3Q4 Marginal Revenue ](./media/image242.png)

# Question 1 (c)

  -  Economic profit = Total revenue - Explicit costs - Implicit costs.

  -  If the firm earns zero economic profit, the accounting profit is
     positive.

# Question 1 (f)

  -  Suppose the long-run average total cost is strictly downward
     sloping. Would it be efficient to build a second bridge? Explain.
    
      -  One point is earned for stating that building a second bridge
         would be inefficient and for explaining that, because there
         are economies of scale, building a second bridge would raise
         the average total cost.

# Question 2 (b)

  -  The law of diminishing returns
    
      -  As more and more units of a variable input are added to a
         fixed input, the output increases at a decreasing rate.

  ![In economics, diminishing returns is the decrease in the marginal
  (incremental) output of a production process as the amount of a single
  factor of production is incrementally increased, while the amounts of
  all other factors of production stay constant. Diminishing returns -

  -  Diminishing returns occur because of the **overuse** of the
     **fixed input**.
