      -  Marginal Cost
    
      -  Marginal Revenue
    
      -  Demand (Price)
    
      -  Average Total Cost

# Question 1 (d)

  -  Long-Run Average Total Cost
    
      -  **Short-run** and **long-run** average total cost curves
         **differ** because a firm can **choose** its fixed cost in the
         **long run**.
    
      -  If a firm plans on producing a **high** amount of output, it
         might make sense to have a **high fixed cost**
    
      -  Conversely, if a firm plans on producing a **small** amount of
         output, it might make sense to have a **low fixed cost**
