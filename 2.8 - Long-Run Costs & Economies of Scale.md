# Short-Run vs. Long-Run Costs

  -  Business must make decisions on whether to spend money **now**
     (**fixed**) or spend money **later** (**variable**)

  -  If a firm plans on producing a **high** amount of output, it might
     make sense to have a **high fixed cost**

  -  Conversely, if a firm plans on producing a **small** amount of
     output, it might make sense to have a **low fixed cost**

  -  Choosing the optimal level of fixed cost requires a lot of
     planning

# Long-Run Average Total Cost (LRATC)

  -  Meaning
    
      -  the relationship between **output** and **average total cost**
         when fixed cost has been chosen to **minimize** average total
         cost for **each level of output**
    
      -  If there are **many possible choices** of fixed cost, the
         long-run average total cost curve will have the familiar,
         **smooth** U shape.

  -  **Short-run** and **long-run** average total cost curves
     **differ** because a firm can **choose** its fixed cost in the
     **long run**.

  -  If Selena has chosen the level of fixed cost that minimizes
     short-run average total cost at an output of **6** cases, and
     actually produces 6 cases, then she will be at point **C** on
     LRATC and ATC6.

  -  But if she produces only **3** cases, then she will move to point
     **B**.

  -  If she expects to produce only 3 cases for **a long time**, in the
     long run she will reduce her fixed cost and move to point **A** on
     ATC3.

  -  Likewise, if she produces **9** cases (putting her at point Y) and
     expects to continue this **for a long time**, she will increase
     her fixed cost in the long run and move to point **X**

  -  Example

  ![• cosy Suppose that a firm that has historically produced 15,000
  caps, experiences a sharp, permanent increase in demand that leads it
  to produce 000 units. Explain how its average total cost will change
  in the short run and in the long-run. Explain what the firm should do
  instead if it believes the change in demand is temporary. CAPS BfC 25

# Returns to Scale

  -  **Economies** of scale
    
      -  when long-run average total cost **declines** as input
         **increases**
    
      -  **ATC decreases** as **Q increases**

  -  **Diseconomies** of scale
    
      -  when long-run average total cost **increases** as output
         **increases**
    
      -  **ATC increases** as **Q increases**

# Sources of Economies of Scale

  -  Increased specialization that larger output levels allow
    
      -  a **larger scale** of operation means that workers are very
         **specialized** individuals

  -  Large initial set-up cost
    
      -  in auto manufacturing, electricity generating or petroleum
         refining, there exist **high fixed costs** to enter the
         industry

  -  Network externalities
    
      -  the effect that **one user** of a good or service has on the
         **value** of that product to **other people**
    
      -  When network effect it present, the value of a product or
         service if dependent on **the number of others using it** (ie.
         Telephone, Facebook, Twitter, eBay)

 

# Sunk Cost

  -  Definition
    
      -  cost that should be **ignored** when making a decision
    
      -  A cost that has **already happened** that **cannot be
         recovered**

  -  As the old saying goes, "There's no use crying over spilled milk"

  -  Example
    
      -  You go to an All You Can Eat Brazilian BBQ Restaurant, pay $40
         after eating a salad and you are full.
    
      -  What's the rational thing to do in order to get your money's
         worth?
    
      -  **WALK OUT\! SUNK COST\!**
    
      -  Marginal Benefit \> Marginal Cost: Keep doing
    
      -  Marginal Cost \> Marginal Benefit: Leave\!
