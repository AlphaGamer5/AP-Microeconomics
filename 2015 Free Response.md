# Question 1 (b)

  -  Graph for a profit-maximizing firm in a perfectly competitive
     constant-cost industry earning positive economic profit
    
      -  Label Market and Firm above each graph

  ![For a perfectly competitive firm average revenue is also equal to
  marginal revenue. Average revenue for a perfectly competitive firm is
  often depicted by a horizontal average revenue curve. Average revenue
  is the revenue generated per unit of output sold. 01 2 S 10 Average

# Question 1 (c)

  -  For a company in a perfectly competitive market
    
      -  Raising the price --\> Quantity falls to 0 --\> Total Revenue
         falls to 0
    
      -  Because the firm is a price taker / is facing a perfectly
         elastic demand / losses all of its customers / has no market
         power

# Question 1 (d)

  -  Lump sum subsidy has no effect on marginal revenue or marginal
     cost

  -  Only fixed costs will be affected.

  -  Positive profits lead to entry of new firms that will increase the
     industry supply.
