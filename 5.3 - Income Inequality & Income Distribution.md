# The problem of Poverty

  -  Definition of poverty is an **arbitrary task**

  -  In the United States, the **poverty threshold** is the minimum
     income required to purchase the necessities of life

  -  Those that fall below this threshold would be considered poor

  -  In 2009 for an adult living alone the figure was at $10,956; for
     two adults and two children, it was at $21,756

  -  Poverty rates fell steeply in the 1960s down to between 10-15% in
     the 1970s. But, despite increased prosperity, the numbers have
     stayed relatively stagnant

 

# Who are the Poor?

  -  In 2009 (according to the US Census Bureau), 43.5 million
     Americans were in poverty, or roughly 4.3% of the population, or
     **1 in 7** people

  -  25.9% of **African-Americans** and 25.3% of **Hispanics** were
     considered poor. 9.4% of non-Hispanic whites below the poverty
     threshold

  -  **Female-headed** households had a poverty rate of 32.5% while
     married couples had a relatively smaller poverty rate of 5.8%

  -  Many part-time workers consist of a category analysts refer to as
     the **working poor**, usually because part-time work does not
     include **health benefits**, **retirement** or **paid vacation**

 

# What Causes Poverty

  -  Lack of **education** is the primary culprit in poverty

  -  In 1979 the average hourly wage of a man with a college education
     was 36% higher than a man with a high school diploma

  -  In 2009 this "college premium" was at 81% -- employers prefer
     workers with more human capital (which going to college usually
     signals to firms)

  -  **Racial and gender discrimination** can be seen as causes

  -  Sometimes, **bad luck** (wage-earner loses job of falls ill) might
     be the reason for poverty

 

# Economic Inequality

  -  In 2008, the average US household income was $60,000

  -  More precisely, the mean income was $68,424 while the median
     income was $50,303

  -  The **ultra-high** salaries of the few (Bill Gates and Mark
     Zuckerberg) will make the **mean greater** than the **median**

  -  Income is unequally distributed as data from the U.S. Census
     Bureau shows

# Gini Coefficient

  -  The most widely used **measure of inequality**, it's a number that
     summarizes a country's level of inequality

  -  High level of inequality (such as Brazil) would be 0.6 whereas in
     Sweden the number is at 0.25

  -  The **US** has a relatively **high Gini** coefficient for such a
     wealthy country. In 2009, the number was at 0.468

  -  **High Gini levels** appear in **Africa** and **South America**

 

# Lorenz Curve

  -  a graph on which the cumulative percentage of total national
     income (or some other variable) is plotted against the cumulative
     percentage of the corresponding population (ranked in increasing
     size of share).

  -  The extent to which the curve sags below a straight diagonal line
     indicates the degree of inequality of distribution.

# Three Types of Taxes

  -  **Proportional Tax**
    
      -  "**flat**" tax that takes a percentage of income regardless of
         the amount of income (ie. Hong Kong)

  -  **Regressive Tax **
    
      -  tax rate **decreases** as the amount subject to taxation
         increases that imposes a **greater burden** on the **poor**
         than the rich (ie. payroll taxes or cigarette taxes)

  -  **Progressive Tax**
    
      -  tax rate that **goes up** as income increases. Most conutries
         (including the US) have **increasingly higher tax** brackets
         for the **wealthy**

 

# Means-Tested Programs

  -  Welfare refers to **money** given to those that fall **below** the
     **poverty threshold**

  -  In the US, Temporary Aid for Needy Families (TANF) assists
     families with children for a limited period of time

  -  Replace the more controversial Aid to Families with Dependent
     Children (AFDC) which created perverse incentives for the poor

  -  Supplemental Security Income help disabled individuals and
     Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program help low-income families
     with food

  -  Negative income tax -- program that creates incentive for low-wage
     earners to make more money (Earned Income Tax Credit)

  -  Food Stamps and Medicaid

 

# Social Security and Unemployment

  -  Largest US welfare program is Social Security

  -  Retirement income for elderly, disable and provides "survivor
     benefits"

  -  Wages subject to tax up maximum amount ($106,800 in 2010)

  -  Unemployment insurance pays 35% of salary until a new job is found
     for a period of time (extended during recessions)

  -  Financed through a tax on employers

  -  **Trade-offs** exist between **efficiency** and **equity**, which
     is ultimately a normative issue
