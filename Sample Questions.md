  8 Inelastic 9 10 Quantity 9 10 Quantity The upper panel shows a demand
  curve corre- sponding to the demand schedule in the table. The lower
  panel shows how total revenue changes along that demand curve: at each
  price and quantity combination, the height of the bar rep- resents the
  total revenue generated. You can see that at a low price, raising the
  price increases total revenue. So demand is inelastic at low prices.
  At a high price, however, a rise in price reduces total revenue. So
  demand is elastic at high prices. Demand is elastic: a higher price
  reduces total revenue. Demand is inelastic: a higher phce increases
  total revenue. ](./media/image61.png)

  -  The **total revenue** (total cost) remains the **same** when
     **demand** is **unit-elastic**

# Question 8

  -  Average variable costs are increasing when marginal costs are
     higher than average variable costs

# Question 10

  -  If **price** falls **less** than **AVC**, then you should **shut
     down** the company.

  -  Long-run (Profitability)

  ![Profitability condition (minimum ATC = break-even price) P \>
  minimum ATC P = minimum ATC P < minimum ATC Result Firm profitable.
  Entry into industry in the long run. Firm breaks even. No entry into
  or exit from industry in the long run. Firm unprofitable. Exit from
  industry in the long run. ](./media/image127.png)

  -  Short-run (Production)

  ![Production condition (minimum AVC = shut-down price) P \> minimum
  AVC P = minimum AVC P < minimum AVC Result Firm produces in the short
  run. If P < minimum ATC, firm covers variable cost and some but not
  all of fixed cost. If P \> minimum ATC, firm covers all variable cost
  and fixed cost. Firm indifferent between producing in the short run or
  not. Just covers variable cost. Firm shuts down in the short run. Does
  not cover variable cost. ](./media/image128.png)

# Question 15

  -  Both **consumers** and **producers bear** a part of the total tax
     **burden**.

# Question 17

  -  Economic Profit = Accounting Profit - Opportunity Cost

  -  In a perfectly competitive industry, the Economic Profit = 0.

  -  So, Account Profit = Opportunity Cost
