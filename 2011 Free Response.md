# Question 1 (a)

  -  Profit per unit = Demand(Price) - ATC

# Question 1 (d)

  ![One point is earned for stating that the demand is inelastic because
  total revenue increases as price increases from $16 to $18, or because
  the price elasticity of demand within the price range is less than 1 ,
  or because marginal revenue is negative. ](./media/image246.png)

# Question 1 (e)

  -  Accounting Profit ≥ Economic Profit

  ![profil profit Economic profit is the difference between total
  monetary revenue and total costs, but total costs include both
  explicit and implicit costs. Economic profit includes the opportunity
  costs associated with production and is therefore lower than
  accounting profit. Difference Between Economic and Accounting Profit -

# Question 1 (f)

  -  Profit = Revenue - Cost

# Question 2 (a)

  -  Graph for a typical firm should include
    
      -  Marginal Cost
    
      -  Marginal Revenue
    
      -  Demand(Price)
    
      -  Average Total Cost

  -  Profit = (Price - ATC)\* Quantity

# Question 2 (c)

  -  A typical labor supply and demand graph should include
    
      -  Marginal Factor Cost: Horizontal
    
      -  Marginal Revenue Product (Marginal Product of Labor): Downward
         sloping
