# Economy's Factors of Production

  -  Land
    
      -  resources that are God-given from **nature**

  -  Labor
    
      -  **work** done by **human beings**

  -  Capital
    
      -  Physical capital: consists of **manufactured productive
         resources** like equipment, buildings or tools
    
      -  Human capital: **skills** and **knowledge** a worker gets from
         education

  -  Entrepreneurship
    
      -  often referred to as the "4th Factor of Production," they
         combine the three resources to make innovative profits by
         **taking risk**

 

# Derived Demand

  -  Definition
    
      -  demand from a **factor** is dericed fomr **firm's output**.

  -  Examples
    
      -  If the demand for flight increase, then the demand for airline
         pilots will also increase
    
      -  After Hurricane Katrina, the demand for houses increased, thus
         increasing the demand for construction
  workers.

# Total Product vs. Marginal Product

  -  Total product shows the total quantity of output produced, which
     will eventually **increase** at a **decreasing rate**

  -  Marginal product of labor will **decrease** as you hire more
     workers due to **diminishing marginal returns**

# Value of the Marginal Product

  -  Meaning
    
      -  The value of the marginal product of a factor is the **value**
         of the **additional output** generated by employing **one
         more** unit of that **factor**.

  VMPL = Value of the Marginal Product of Labor
  
  MRP = Marginal Revenue Product

  -  Formula
    
      -  VMPL = **P \* MPL**
    
      -  MRP = P \* MPL

  -  Hiring decision rule
    
      -  Hire the extra worker if VMPL \>W
    
      -  **VMPL = W** at the profit-maximizing level of employment
    
      -  Example
        
          -  If the 5th worker produces 7 radios in the one day which
             sell for $10 each and his daily wage rate equals $10,
             should you hire the worker?
        
          -  VMPL = P \* MPL = 10 \* 7 = 70 < W = 100

  -  Curve

![Wage rate, VMPL $400 300 Market 200 wage rate 100 1 2 3 4 5 Optimal
point 6 7 Value of the marginal product of labor curve, VMPL 8 Quantity
of labor (workers) Profit-maximizing number of workers
](./media/image160.png)

  -  This curve shows how the **value of marginal product of labor**
     depends on the **number of workers** employed.

  -  It slopes **downward** because of diminishing returns to labor in
     production

  -  To maximize profit, you should choose the level of employment at
     which the value of the **marginal product of labor** is equal to
     the **market wage** rate

 

# Shifts of the Factor Demand Curve

  -  Changes in the price of goods
    
      -  If the price of wheat, increases, what happens to the VMPL of
         wheat?

  ![Wage rate Market wage $200 rate 5 VMPL2 VMPLI 8 Quantity of labor
  (workers) ](./media/image161.png)

  -  Change in supply of other factors
    
      -  If the workers decrease their productivity due to a loos of
         land, what happens to the VMPL?

  ![Wage rate • $200 c 2 VMPLI VMPL3 5 Quantity of labor (workers)
  ](./media/image162.png)

  -  Changes in Technology
    
      -  The usual impact of technological process will shift the MPL
         (and thus VMPL) to the
  right

# Factor Market Example

  ![Qty of Unskilled Workers Qty of Shirts Produced 30 50 65 68 70
  ](./media/image164.png)
  
  Assume that Samantha's Shirt Company sells shirts at $15 and pays a
  wage of $85 a day. Assume labor is the only output.

  -  Draw a correctly labeled graph of SSC's current supply curve for
     unskilled labor
    
      -  **Put Q<sub>L</sub> on the x-axis, and W on the y-axis**
    
      -  Perfectively competitive labor
  market

  ![C:\\CE5A5F25\\EA5686BB-78FF-4844-9ADF-D3586C9ED368\_files\\image165.png](./media/image165.png)

  -  What is SSC's profit maximizing level?

| Q<sub>L </sub> | Q  | MPL | P  | MRP/VMPL | W  |
| -------------- | -- | --- | -- | -------- | -- |
| 0              | 0  |     |    |          |    |

| 6              | 70 | 2   | 15 | 30       | 85 |

  -  When Q<sub>L</sub> = 3, **MRP/VMPL \> W**

  -  When Q<sub>L</sub> = 4, **MRP/VMPL < W**

  -  Answer: **Produce 60 shirts** and hire 3 workers

<!-- end list -->

  -  Suppose SSC **loses technology** that **decrease** the
     **productivity** of its unskilled workers. How will the new
     technology affect the quantity of unskilled labor SSC hires?
    
      -  The MRP decreases, because MPL has decreased.
    
      -  The quantity of Labor will decrease

  -  How will the new technology affect the wage paid to SSC's
     unskilled workers
    
      -  Wage is unaffected because wage is perfectly elastic or
         constant

# Another Factor Market Example

  ![Quantity of Workers Number of Pins per Day 10 30 45 55 58 59
  ](./media/image167.png)
  
  Sus & Jib is a profit-maximizing pin-making firm that can sell pins at
  a price of $20 each. Sus & Jib can hire workers at a market wage of
  $120 per day per worker

  -  In what market structure does this company sell its products?
    
      -  **perfect competition** because **price** is the **same** and
         **no differentiation**.

  -  In what market structure do the laborers work in?
    
      -  **perfect competition** because **wage** rate is **constant **

  -  Calculate the value of the marginal product of labor of the third
     worker
    
      -  MRP = (45 - 30) \* 30 = 15 \* 20 = 300

  -  What is the profit-maximizing output level?

| Q<sub>L </sub> | Q  | MPL | P  | MRP/VMPL | W   |
| -------------- | -- | --- | -- | -------- | --- |
| 0              | 0  |     |    |          |     |

| 6              | 59 | 1   | 20 | 30       | 120 |

  -  Profit-maximizing output level is 55-58 pins with 4-5 workers
