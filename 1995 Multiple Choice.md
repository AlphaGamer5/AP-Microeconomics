# Question 3

  -  The intention of the government in creating the **price floor** is
     to **assist** the **producers** of the good.

  ![In panel (a), the government imposes a price ceiling of $4. Because
  the price ceiling is above the equilibrium price of $3, the price
  ceiling has no effect, and the market can reach the equilibrium of
  supply and demand. In this equilibrium, quantity supplied and quantity
  demanded both equal 100 cones. In panel (b), the government imposes a
  price ceiling of $2. Because the price ceiling is below the
  equilibrium price of $3, the market price equals $2. At this price,
  125 cones are demanded and only 75 are supplied, so there is a
  shortage of FIGURE 1 A Market with a Price Ceiling 50 cones. Price of

# Question 5

  -  Consumer surplus: the difference between the buyer's **willingness
     to pay** versus what he **actually pays**

# Question 15

  -  The source of inequality
    
      -  Discrimination in employment
    
      -  Differences in personal motivation
    
      -  Differences in educational level attained
    
      -  Differences in abilities

  -  Progressive income taxes are a way to correct income inequality

# Question 38

  ![Concepts and Measures of Cost FC/Q AVC- VC/Q Short run Short run and
  long run Long run Measurement Fixed cost Average fixed cost Variable
  cost Average variable cost Total cost Average total cost (average
  cost) Marginal cost Long-run average total cost Definition Cost that
  does not depend on the quantity of output produced Fixed cost per unit
  of output Cost that depends on the quantity of output produced
  Variable cost per unit of output The sum of fixed cost (short run) and
  variable cost Total cost per unit of output The change in total cost
  generated by producing one more unit of output Average total cost when
  fixed cost has been chosen to minimize average total cost for each
  level of output Mathematical term FC vc TC- FC (short run) ATC- TC/Q
  MC = ATC/AQ LRATC ](./media/image194.png)

  -  There are **economies of scale** when long-run average total cost
     **declines** as output **increases**.

  -  There are **diseconomies of scale** when long-run average total
     cost **increases** as output **increases**.

  -  There are **increasing returns to scale** when **output increases
     more** than in proportion to an increase in all **inputs**.

  -  There are **decreasing returns to scale** when **output increases
     less** than in proportion to an increase in all **inputs**.

  -  There are **constant returns to** **scale** when **output
     increases directly** in proportion to an increase in all
     **inputs**.

# Question 57

  -  **No economic profit** in the long run for **Perfect Competition**
     and **Monopolistic Competition**

  Efficient. Each seller prices at cost. No rents. Only transfer
  earnings. Zero economic profits. Price = Minimum AC. Ideal sociai
  pricing P = MC p = MR Fewer than perfect competition, more than
  oligopoly/ monopoly (some price-makers). Imperfect substitutions.
  Imperfect elasticity. Depends on degree of innovation. Heterogeneous.
  Mostly non-price competition; some independent pricing. Weak barriers
  to entry/exit. Inefficiency, excess capacity since P = AC (but not at
  minimum). p = AC; tendency for LR zero economic profits. P \> MC
  idop\&ly Few sellers who have some control of market share;
  interdependence. Fewer substitutes available = market pricing power.
  Varies. Greater elasticity at high prices. Lower elasticity at lower
  prices. Some markets— homogeneous for specialty products. Other
  markets heterogeneous products. Much interdepen- dence in pricing.
