# Welfare Effects of Monopoly

  -  Monopoly vs. Perfect Competition (Surplus)
    
      -  Assume a **downward** sloping demand curve for both monopoly
         and prefect competition with a **constant MC** as well as
         **ATC**
    
      -  In a monopoly, the **marginal revenue** will be **below** the
         **demand curve**.
    
      -  Consumer **surplus** is **reduced** and **deadweight** loss
         (DWL) is **created**

  -  Summary
    
      -  By holding output level **below** the level at which
         **marginal cost** is **equal** to the **market price**, a
         monopolist **increases profits** but **decreases consumer
         surplus**
    
      -  Mutually beneficial transactions do not occur, but a
         monopolist is (**naturally**) looking out for its own
         interests.
    
      -  **Perfectly competitive** firms also profit-maximize, but they
         produce where **P = MC**, which is also **MR = MC**
    
      -  Monopolists produce at **MR = MC**, but **P \> MC**
    
      -  This creates **deadweight loss** or DWL

 

# Public Ownership of Monopolies

  -  Many countries opt for **public ownership** of **natural
     monopolies** (economies of scale)

  -  In theory, the government can set prices based on **efficiency (P
     = MC)** rather than **profit maximization (MR = MC)**

  -  In practice, publicly owned firms have **less incentives** to
     **keep costs down** or **offer high quality**

  -  Electricity, local phone service, water and gas are examples of
     regulated monopolies

  -  Should the government regulate cable TV?

 

# Unregulated vs. Regulated Natural Monopoly

  -  Assume a demand curve for both situations with a demand
     intersecting ATC on downward-sloping portion

  -  **Unregulated** monopoly charges **MR = MC** (econ profit)

  -  **Regulated** monopoly charges (normal profit)

  -  Assume instead that a lump-sum subsidy is provided to Zachrail. In
     the short run, will **deadweight loss** increase, decrease of not
     change? Will Zachrail's **economic losses** increase, decrease or
     not change?
    
      -  **Lump-sum subsidy** lowers FC, which **lowers** the **ATC**
