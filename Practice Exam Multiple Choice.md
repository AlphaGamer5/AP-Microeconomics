# Question 7

  -  MC = W/MPL

  ![The Connection Between Input Demand & Output Supply • In general: MC
  = WIMPL Notice: • To produce additional output, hire more labor. As L
  rises, MPL falls... • causing WIMPL to rise... • causing MC to rise.
  Hence, diminishing marginal product and increasing marginal cost are
  two sides of the same coin. THE MARKETS FOR THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION

  ![The Connection Between Input Demand & Output Supply The competitive
  firm's rule for demanding labor: PxMPL=W Divide both sides by MPL: p =
  W/ MPL Substitute MC = WIMPL from previous slide: p = MC This is the
  competitive firm's rule for supplying output. Hence, input demand and
  output supply are two sides of the same coin. THE MARKETS FOR THE

# Question 8

  -  Operate if Loss < Fixed Cost

  ![Producing at a loss Producing at a loss Loss MC ATC AVC P = MR Fixed
  costs if shut down MC ATC AVC Loss ](./media/image294.png)

  -  As demonstrated in the table, if the price is below average total
     cost but above average variable cost, losses are minimized by
     producing 50 units and incurring a loss of $3.50.

  -  If the firm shut down, it would still have to pay fixed cost of
     five.

  -  Since average variable costs at 50 units is 42 cents and the price
     is 45 cents, it covers the variable costs and contributes three
     cents on each unit toward the paying the fixed costs.

  -  Three cents times 50 units is $1.50 which is the amount the firm
     has **reduced** their **loss** by **producing instead of shutting
     down**.

# Question 9 

  -  In the long-run the profit for a monopolistically competitive frim
     is 0

  ![Monopolistic Competition in the Long Run Graph summary — A key idea
  is free entry and exit. — If the industry is profitable, other firms
  will enter, causing the demand for existing firms' products to
  decrease — If the industry is experiencing losses, firms will exit,
  causing demand for remaining firms' products to increase — Entry and
  exit will stop when profits are zero. This occurs when P = ATC.

# Question 11

  -  The Marginal Revenue of a firm in a perfectly competitive industry
     is constant

  ![For a perfectly competitive firm average revenue is also equal to
  marginal revenue. Average revenue for a perfectly competitive firm is
  often depicted by a horizontal average revenue curve. Average revenue

# Question 26

  -  The Effect of an Increase in Demand
    
      -  An **increase** in the **demand** for a product causes the
         **equilibrium price** and **quantity** to **increase** in the
         market.
    
      -  An **increase** in **demand** raises **price** and **profit**,
         which causes **more suppliers** to enter the market
    
      -  Higher industry output from new entrants drives **price** and
         **profit** back **down** to its **original** equilibrium

  Increase in output from new entrants Panel (b) shows how an industry
  adjusts in the short and long run to an increase in demand; panels (a)
  and (c) show the corresponding adjustments by an existing firm.
  Initially the market is at point XMKT in panel (b), a short-run and
  long-run equilibrium at a price of $14 and industry output of Qx. An
  existing firm makes zero economic profit, operating at point X in
  panel (a) at minimum average total cost. Demand increases as DI shifts
  rightward to D2 in panel (b), raising the market price to $18.
  Existing firms increase their output, and industry output moves along
  the short-run industry supply curve Sl to a short-run equilibrium at
  YMKT. Correspondingly, the existing firm in panel (a) moves from point
  X to point Y. But at a price of $18 existing firms are profitable. As
  shown in panel (b), in the long run new entrants arrive and the
  short-run industry supply curve shifts rightward, from Sl to S2. There
  is a new equilibrium at point ZMKT, at a lower price of $14 and higher
  industry output of Qz. An existing firm responds by moving from Y to Z
  in panel (c), returning to its initial output level and zero economic
  profit. Production by new entrants accounts for the total increase in
  industry output, Qz— Qx. Like XMKT, ZMKTis also a short-run and
  long-run equilibrium: with existing firms earning zero economic
  profit, there is no incentive for any firms to enter or exit the
  industry. The horizontal line passing through XMKT and ZMKT, LRS, is
  the long-run industry supply curve: at the break-even price of $14,
  producers will produce any amount that consumers demand in the long
  run. ](./media/image119.png)

# Question 38

  -  The short-run supply curve for a firm in a perfectly competitive
     industry is its marginal cost curve above the minimum point of its
     **average variable cost** curve

  -  In the short run the firm needs only to cover its **variable
     costs** (at Q1 below) – this is largely because covering variable
     cost ensures than an output can be produced in the future - if
     variable costs cannot be covered then no further output can be
     made.

  -  In addition, fixed costs have already been paid for prior to any
     marginal decision to supply, so do not enter into the firm’s short
     run calculations.
