# Supply and Demand

  -  Supply and demand model
    
      -  a model of how a **competitive market** functions

  -  The demand curve

  -  The supply curve

  -  The **determinants** of demand and supply

  -  The **equilibrium** price and quantity

 

# Demand Schedule and Demand Curve

  -  The law of demand
    
      -  A **higher** price leads to a **lower** quantity demaned
    
      -  A **lower** price leads to a **higher** quantity demanded

  -  Demand schedule vs. demand curve
    
      -  A demand **schedule** is a **table** that shows the quantity
         demanded at each price.
    
      -  A demand **curve** is a **graph** that shows the quantity
         demanded at each price

  -  Demand vs. quantity
demanded
    
      - 

| demand            | the relationship between **a range of prices** and the **quantities demanded** at those prices, as illustrated by a demand curve or a demand schedule. |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| quantity demanded | only **a certain point** on the demand curve or **one quantity** on the demand schedule                                                                |

  -  **Demand** refers to the **curve**, and **quantity demanded**
     refers to a **specific point** on the curve.

  -  If price increases, what happens?
    
      -  No change in **demand **
    
      -  Decrease in **quantity demanded**

  -  Graphical Comparison

# Shift of the Demand Curve

  -  Changes in the price of related goods
    
      -  Substitutes (**positive** correlation)
        
          -  **fall in the price** of one goods makes consumers **less
             willing** to buy the other good
    
      -  Complements (**negative** correlation)
        
          -  **fall in the price** of one of the goods makes consumers
             **more willing** to buy the other good
    
      -  How to remember
        
          -  Kids are **positive** when having a **substitute** teacher
        
          -  We lived in a cynical world. If someone gives you a
             **complement**, the true intention might be **negative**.

  -  Changes in income
    
      -  **Normal** goods
        
          -  rise in income **increases** demand
        
          -  ie. computers, Disneyland, steak
    
      -  **Inferior** goods
        
          -  rise in income **decreases** demand
        
          -  ie. macaroni & cheese, top ramen
    
      -  Normal goods vs. inferior goods

  ![Why do we say "most goods," not "all goods"? Most goods are normal
  goods— the demand for them increases when consumer income rises.
  However, the demand for some products falls when income rises. Goods
  for which demand decreases when income rises are known as inferior
  goods. Usually an inferior good is one that is considered less
  desirable than more expensive alternatives—such as a bus ride versus a
  taxi ride. When they can afford to, people stop buying an inferior
  good and switch their consumption to the preferred, more expensive
  alternative. So when a good is inferior, a rise in income shifts the
  demand curve to the left. And, not surprisingly, a fall in income
  shifts the demand curve to the right. ](./media/image29.png)

  -  Changes in tastes
    
      -  Why do people want what they want?
    
      -  Changes due to fad, beliefs, cultural shifts are all clumped
         together under **preferences.**

  -  Changes in expectations
    
      -  If you expect **more income** in the future, demand for
         certain goods (ie. car or refrigerator) might **increase**
    
      -  If expectation of a future **price drop** of items exist, then
         the demand for these items **drop** today, almost like a
         self-fulfilling
  prophecy.

# Supply Schedule and Supply Curve

  -  The law of supply
    
      -  A **higher** price leads to a **higher** quantity supplied.
    
      -  A **lower** price leads to a **lower** quantity supplied.

  -  Supply schedule vs. supply curve
    
      -  A supply **schedule** is a **table** that shows the quantity
         supplied at each price.
    
      -  A supply **curve** is a **graph** that shows the quantity
         supplied at each price.

  -  Supply vs. quantity
supplied
    
      - 

| supply            | the relationship between **a range of prices** and the **quantities supplied** at those prices, as illustrated by a supply curve or a supply schedule. |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| quantity supplied | only **a certain point** on the supply curve or **one quantity** on the supply schedule                                                                |

  -  **Supply** refers to the **curve**, and **quantity supplied**
     refers to a **specific point** on the curve.

  -  If price increase, what happens to supply?
    
      -  **Nothing**
    
      -  This is a change in quantity supplied not supply


# Shifts of the Supply Curve

  -  Changes in input prices
    
      -  Input is a good used to **produce another** good
    
      -  ie. cheese in a cheese pizza

  -  Change in technology
    
      -  All the ways in which people can **turn more inputs into
         useful goods**
    
      -  For example, an improved strain of corn resistant to disease
         increase supply of corn.

  -  Change in expectations
    
      -  If **expectations** of a future price **increase** of items
         exist, then supplier will tend to **hoard** the item in order
         to make **more profit** in the future.

  -  Related goods
    
      -  If the price of other things I can produce goes up, then my
         supply of grapes, once again, would go down.

# Supply, Demand, and Equilibrium

  -  Equilibrium price
    
      -  price that **clears the market**

  -  Equilibrium quantity
    
      -  quantity of good bought and sold at **market-clearing price**

  -  Equilibrium
    
      -  where the supply and demand curves
  **intersect**
