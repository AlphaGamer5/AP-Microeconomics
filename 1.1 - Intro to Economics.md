  ![marginal change a small incremental adjustment to a plan of action
  Rational people know that decisions in life are rarely black and white
  but usu- ally involve shades of gray. At dinnertime, the question you
  face is not "Should I fast or eat like a pig?" More likely, you will
  be asking yourself "Should I take that extra spoonful of mashed
  potatoes?" When exams roll around, your decision is not between
  blowing them off and studying twenty-four hours a day but whether to
  spend an extra hour reviewing your notes instead of watching TV.
  Economists use the term marginal change to describe a small
  incremental adjustment to an existing plan of action. Keep in mind
  that margin means "edge," so marginal changes are adjustments around
  the edges of what you are doing. Rational people often make decisions
  by comparing marginal benefits and marginal costs.
